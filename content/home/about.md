# Biography

I am a last-year PhD student in [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) (NTU) Singapore. I am affiliated to [Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education in Singapore](http://www.cares.cam.ac.uk/) (CARES) as well. My research interest centers on [energy system]({{< ref "post/energy-system.md" >}}), lies in the intersection between modeling, optimization and control. My research is also driven by the [recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence together with their impact on energy system design and operation]({{< ref "publication/2017_wes.md" >}}), especially energy use in urban environment. In one sentence, the ultimate goal of my research is harnessing the power of computational intelligence for "smart" and "low-carbon" energy system.
