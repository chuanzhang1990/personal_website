# Biography

I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Energy Systems Analysis Group ([ESAG](https://acee.princeton.edu/research/energy-systems-analysis-group/)), a research unit at the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/), [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). Before I obtained my PhD from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg) Singapore under Cambridge [CARES](http://www.cares.cam.ac.uk/). My research interest centers on energy transition, lies in the intersection between system modeling, environmental assessment and economics analysis. In particular, I evaluate the decarbonization potential, including cost-effectiveness, for various technologies in energy sector. I am also interested in the recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence together with their impact on energy system design and operation.
