In scientific community, a very question people like to ask each other is “what do you do” or “what is your research about”. Interestingly, every time I said “I work on energy” or something like that, I was in trouble. Depending on the background of your fellow, they may have quite different perspectives on what energy is and what is energy research about: if you are talking to material scientist, they could think energy is all about developing better electrode materials which could result in high-performance batteries; if you are talking to chemist, they might think energy is basically about finding novel catalysts or reaction path which would turn CO2 into fossil fuels (this is exactly my girlfriend does); if you are talking to electric engineers, they might think energy is about resilient power grid which could accommodate more renewable generation; and so on so force. They are all correct in the sense that if they manage to fully unleash their research potential at industrial scale, the energy trilemma could be largely tackled. However, we have to admit that although scientists worldwide have achieved impressive progresses in these domains, the overall landscape of energy conversion and utilization has not changed since industrial revolution.

The Sankey diagram of 2016 energy use in U.S. clearly shows that the bulk of global energy consumption comes from fossil fuel, more importantly the energy conversion technologies (technologies converting raw materials into usable energy carrier, such as electricity, for end users) are basically power plant and refineries. Even more, it could be projected that nothing would change in near future, unless disruptive technology breakthrough happens, for example artificial photosynthesis power plant at the scale of current fossil fuel power plant is successfully implemented. In such a context, I personally think it is very important to unleash the potential from intra-system re-innovation, I mean given no fundamental changes of component level performance leap, some priority should be given to system level design and optimization which would make the performance of each single component at their best value. Of course, this is not easy because on one side, the energy system landscape (what technologies are used, how they are designed and operated etc.) has been there for decades with high techno-institutional inertial that are quite difficult to overcome; on the other side, I think this research direction has not been paid much attention compared to other aspects. Many researchers do not give this a shit because they think energy system design and optimization is a super engineered or (so-called applied) research without scientific meanings, sequentially no publication on Nature, Science. This is correct, and this is not correct. This is correct because there is no scientific community that specialized on this topic, energy researchers are from various backgrounds with their own basis, so they only justify the soundness of their basis; this is not correct because more and more people are getting serious about system-level innovation.
