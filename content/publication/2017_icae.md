abstract = "This paper presents new insights into constructing a cyber-infrastructure system, called J-Park Simulator, for the resource and energy management of eco-industrial parks. The concept of Industry 4.0 is applied to develop the system. Advanced information modeling and managing technology â€“ ontology technology is introduced to build the knowledge base for J-Park Simulator, which delivers a decentralized information managing system. The system allows information of the individual entities been managed locally by the entity themselves, in the meanwhile facilitates information sharing via the Internet and/or intranet. A bottom-up object-oriented approach is adopted to partition and organize information of the complex eco-industrial park. The proposed work addresses key issues in computer-aided design and operation of eco-industrial parks in the context of realizing Industry 4.0."
