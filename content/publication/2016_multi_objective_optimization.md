abstract = "Based on share of energy, materials, resources and information, Eco Industrial Park (EIP) has become a popular form of industry cluster. Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) in EIP can significantly increase the total energy efficiency of the whole park, meanwhile reducing its greenhouse gas emission. The current paper proposes a methodology to assess the opportunities of WHR in EIP at park level. Four different steps are included in this methodology. The first step is identification of waste heat source plants and sink plants in EIP; the second step is the establishment of the waste heat transportation system; the third step is a Single-Objective Optimization Problem (SOOP); the fourth step is Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP). An EIP on Jurong Island Singapore comprising of five plants and two communities is used as a case study to demonstrate the capability of this methodology. Two different operation modes for the EIP are considered: with continuous waste heat and with discontinuous waste heat over time. The first scenario shows that SOOP and MOOP will deliver different WHR networks; the second scenario shows that waste heat discontinuity has great influence on the optimization of the WHR network."
